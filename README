A Sudoku solver using recursive backtracking in Java.

Takes a plain-text file containing the unsolved puzzle in matrix form,
with 0's for the unknowns. The example provided is from http://www.websudoku.com,
and an evil one. The program can solve it, provided you run it with a 
stack size of about 50m. For simpler Sudoku's, you will not need this big
of a stack size.
